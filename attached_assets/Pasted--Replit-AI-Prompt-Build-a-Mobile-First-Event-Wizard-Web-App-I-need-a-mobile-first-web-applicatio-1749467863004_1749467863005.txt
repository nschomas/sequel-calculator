ðŸ§  Replit AI Prompt: Build a Mobile-First Event Wizard Web App

I need a mobile-first web application designed for a one-time customer event. Attendees will access the app via a QR code and proceed through a wizard-like flow consisting of five steps, each on a separate screen.

Requirements:

User Input Flow:

Step 1: Practice Name (free text input, no validation)

Step 2: Monthly Comprehensive Exams (numeric input, max 4 digits)

Step 3: Optical Conversion Rate (numeric input, max 100)

Step 4: Percentage of Optical Business that is Cash Pay (numeric input, max 100)

Step 5: Percentage of MVC Patients Converted to Cash Pay in Optical (numeric input, max 100)

Data Handling:

Store user inputs locally for calculation and presentation purposes.

Send a POST request after each step to a Supabase backend.

Ensure the flow continues seamlessly even if the POST request fails.

Supabase Integration:

Design a Supabase table named responses with the following schema:

id: UUID (Primary Key, auto-generated)

practice_name: Text

comprehensive_exams: Integer

optical_conversion_rate: Numeric

cash_pay_percentage: Numeric

mvc_conversion_percentage: Numeric

browser: Text

device: Text

os: Text

ip_address: Text

user_agent: Text

created_at: Timestamp (auto-generated)

Capture browser, device, OS, IP address, and user agent information using appropriate libraries (e.g., UAParser.js for user agent parsing).

Summary Results:

After the five steps, display a summary screen with three tables:

Table 1: Projected Patient Numbers

Columns: Cash Pay Patients, MVC Patients, Monthly Orders

Rows: Sequel, Neurolens

Table 2: Monthly Revenue and Profit

Columns: Monthly Revenue, Monthly Profit

Rows: Sequel, Neurolens, Total

Table 3: Annualized Revenue and Profit

Same structure as Table 2, with values multiplied by 12

Calculations:

For Sequel:

Cash Pay Patients = ((Comprehensive Exams * Optical Conversion Rate) * 0.6) * Cash Pay %

MVC Patients = ((Comprehensive Exams * Optical Conversion Rate) * 0.6) * MVC Conversion %

Monthly Orders = Cash Pay Patients + MVC Patients

For Neurolens:

Cash Pay Patients = ((Comprehensive Exams * Optical Conversion Rate) * 0.3) * Cash Pay %

MVC Patients = ((Comprehensive Exams * Optical Conversion Rate) * 0.3) * MVC Conversion %

Monthly Orders = Cash Pay Patients + MVC Patients

Revenue and Profit:

Sequel: $460 revenue, $247 profit per order

Neurolens: $800 revenue, $427 profit per order

Monthly Revenue = Monthly Orders * Revenue per order

Monthly Profit = Monthly Orders * Profit per order

Annualized figures = Monthly figures * 12

User Experience:

Mobile-first responsive design.

One question per screen to reduce cognitive load.

Include progress indicators to show users their position in the flow.

Provide Next, Back, and Restart Flow buttons.

No separate completion screen after the summary tables.

Branding:

Apply styling according to the Sequel Brand Guidelines (to be provided).

Additional Notes:

Ensure that each user's session is uniquely identifiable, allowing for traceability and the ability to revisit and recalculate summaries.

Implement error handling to log any issues with data submission to Supabase without interrupting the user flow.

No authentication is required for users to access and use the app.
