Brand Guide 
Overview
These guidelines outline the Sequel verbal identity and visual 
identity. They should serve as both guidance and inspiration to 
create effective, recognizable, and distinct communications. 

While the Sequel identity is well-defined, it’s also flexible enough 
that visionaries should be able to create future assets with the aid 
of these guidelines. Close attention to the guidelines will help 
ensure all communication efforts remain consistent and true to 
the spirit of the brand we’ve built together.

Parent Brand 
Strategy Overview
Our parent brand strategy includes a set of strategic components 
that capture the essence of who we are and lay the foundation for 
each product brand. Distilled into compact words, phrases, and 
personas, these elements help us stay focused and grounded, and 
serve to define our ideal reputation. Sharing these elements 
across our product brands will allow us to maintain our overall 
position in the market, yet give the product brands freedom to 
differentiate and distinctly express themselves depending on their 
value proposition and target audience.

Our positioning statement clearly 
articulates how we are different, 
ultimately helping to amplify our brands 
in a noisy landscape. This statement is 
crafted to align internal teams and all 
marketing efforts to support a clear, 
cohesive, standout brand identity 
externally. 

This statement serves to�
� Illustrate our mission as an innovator 
and visionary — to shift the perspective 
of what eye care can be (and treat)�
� Break us out of the eye care category 
into the health care and wellness space�
� Position us against lengthy, invasive 
procedures and treatments (pharma, 
chiropractic, botox, etc.)�
� Highlight our drive to enhance both the 
eye care experience and everyday life 
experience with an uplifting tone�
� Capture a range of audiences and 
product value propositions�
� Align with our challenger sales model — 
helping OD’s rethink how their practice 
operates.
Re-envisioning health 
and wellness to ease 
your everyday.

## Page 7

Brand personality defines our voice and 
distinctive character. It reflects how we 
show up and addresses the following 
questions: What do we want people to 
think about how we sound, look, and act? 
How is our personality different from any 
other brand in our industry?

While each attribute offers its own 
distinct value, it’s the combination of 
these traits that makes a brand truly 
ownable. Though our product brands share 
this set of personality attributes, how 
each product brand expresses them can be 
different to support distinction between 
them.
Ingenious
We’re a true original with an independent 
spirit who innovates without pretense or 
superficiality.
Polished
We’re proven and premium — approaching 
everything with a keen sense of refinement.
We champion everyone on their wellness 
journey with positivity, authenticity, and 
a fresh perspective.
Uplifting
We’re driven to create products and 
experiences that enrich lives and move 
the industry forward.

Optometry practices led by tech-forward ODs looking for advanced diagnostics and 
patient-centric solutions. Driven to raise care standards, they are hungry for cutting-edge 
technology that addresses more than vision: their patients’ overall health and lifestyle 
challenges. Their ambitions are met with an industry lagging behind their vision for care 
and the vast challenges of managing a practice. They desire a technology partner that shares 
their drive to create impactful patient experiences that, in turn, grows their business.

People who are actively looking for new ways to enhance their daily lives. They’re eager and 
willing to invest in their everyday wellness whether they struggle with eye strain and fatigue 
or need relief from debilitating migraines. They’ve likely tried traditional treatment options 
with little success and not looked to vision care as the answer. While they’re open to trying 
innovative treatments and technologies, they need to understand not only how it can help 
them, but how many others it helped as well. For the Wellness Seeker seeing is believing.

Anyone at any age who is hyper-connected to screens and using digital devices or working 
at near distance 4+ hours per day. Their time spent on screens has caused them to 
experience eye strain, fatigue or discomfort. While they may not have more extreme 
symptoms that Neurolens can relieve (i.e., migraines, neck pain, dizziness,) they are looking 
to invest in an easy solution to help them feel fresh and energized throughout their day.

Verbal Identity

Sequel Brand Guidelines

## Page 13

A verbal identity is a brand’s unique way of communicating 
through language. Just like individual humans, brands have 
distinct voices, rhythms, and ways of speaking. It’s how brands 
with similar products and value propositions — think shoe 
companies like Nike, adidas, and PUMA — distinguish themselves 
from one another. Our verbal identity has little to do with the 
content of our message, but a massive impact on how we deliver 
it. It informs everything from word choice to sentence structure 
and overall tone, all intended to help us consistently reflect the 
brand personality and positioning outlined in our brand strategy.

Identity Overview

## Page 14

Our brand voice is how we speak to the 
world. Defining our voice helps us own a 
distinct personality and remain consistent 
across our communications. This is the 
persona we will adopt when communicating 
as Sequel.
Brand Voice

Accessible and creative
Direct and focused
Positive and empowering
Driven and empathetic
We celebrate innovation using language everyone can understand. Witticism and 
wordplay are welcome. Jargon, self-congratulation, and tech speak are not.
Like our lenses, our voice is crystal clear. We keep our story and our copy tight, 
highlighting only what customers and patients need to know.
Sequel doesn’t just enhance a person’s vision. It improves their life. Our messaging 
should support and empower, highlighting the possibilities ahead in a voice that 
feels warm, optimistic, and honest.
Patients are the heart of everything we do, and our language reflects that. We meet 
our patients where they are, using relatable situations and real-world outcomes to 
demonstrate the impact of our work on their world.

It’s important to maintain a consistent 
style when writing for Sequel. The 
following guidance will help ensure all 
copy is reflective of the brand — and 
grammatically correct, too.
Technical 
Guidance
Unless otherwise noted in the guidelines, we follow the 
AP Stylebook across all our written communications. Got a 
question about punctuation, hyphenation, or how to write a 
number? The AP Stylebook will show you the way.
Avoid wordy sentences and redundancies. Brevity makes us 
memorable and respects our audience’s time. Our voice is 
strongest when it’s read in small and digestible messages. 
Unless it’s technical, we try to not repeat ourselves.
Words and phrases can have unintended consequences if we 
aren’t vigilant. Always fact-check metaphors, idioms, and 
other figures of speech for harmful etymology.
Our sole departure from the AP Stylebook is the serial or 
“Oxford” comma. To avoid confusion, create clarity, and give 
us maximum control over the order of our lists, we use the 
serial comma across the brand.
Contractions like “it’s” and “don’t” are more conversational 
and concise than their formal alternatives. Unless context 
suggests otherwise, use contractions to sound more natural 
and relatable.
Sometimes the best way to communicate information is with a 
list. When we’re conveying facts and figures, use bullet points. 
When the information is instructional, or the order matters, use 
a numbered list.
In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the 
action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the 
action performed to it. Use the active voice because it’s more 
directive and purposeful.
One of the best ways to break through to your audience is by 
speaking directly to them. Don’t be shy about writing in the 
second person and addressing the reader/listener as “you.”
Trust the AP Stylebook.
Keep it short and sweet.
Use inclusive language.
Use the serial comma.
Embrace the contraction.
Don’t dodge bullets.
Use the active voice.
Avoid passive voice.
Hey, you! 
That’s right, you!

Visual Identity

## Page 21

Our visual identity is a unified system comprising core elements 
such as brandmark, typography, and color, as well as extended 
expressions including technical linework and iconography. This 
wide range of tools is designed to be flexible and expandable. To 
effectively define the brand, these core elements must be aligned 
across every touchpoint, from the website to a presentation deck.

## Page 22

These marks act as the primary indicators 
of the brand. When used correctly, our 
brand will remain cohesive and unified 
across all touchpoints, which builds trust 
and recognition among our audience.

Our wordmark features rounded, fluid, 
connected letters that signal an 
approachable B2C lifestyle brand.

Our symbol furthers this notion of comfort 
and ease in the form of an eye-inspired 
mark with a hidden ‘S’ inside. The symbol 
feels kinetic and full of life, reflective 
of how patients feel after using Sequel.

The wordmark is our primary brandmark. 
Use it most often when layout and space 
allow for a horizontal lockup.  
Leaving enough space around the wordmark 
ensures legibility and impact by isolating 
it from competing visual elements such as 
text and supporting graphics.

The clear space around our logo is defined 
by .5 the height of our symbol.

The minimum size for our Logo is

All brandmarks should use these approved 
colorways. Note that brandmarks always

When implementing brandmarks in new  
designs, default to black or white, as we 
more often use yellow 100 for background 
floods and the occasional accent.

Don’t ignore spacing and crop rules.

## Page 29

There’s power in simplicity and focus. 
That’s why Sequel’s color palette is 
intentionally simple, bold, and 
approachable. Our primary shade of yellow 
(Yellow 100) captures the vibrance and 
optimism that the brand is associated 
with.

Yellow 200, 300, and 400 should be 
reserved for when the stark contrast of 
black on yellow isn’t required. Try 
layering these darker shades over 
Yellow 100 for more tonal nuance. 

A suite of grays primarily exists for UI 
needs and other applications where text 
set in charcoal is too heavy. The range of 
grays offers difference in visual 
hierarchy, especially with limited font 
styles.
*Note: Differences in substrate and process 
can affect color. Variations in color also 
may occur on-screen as a result of 
different screen calibrations and/or 
software application being used. The RGB

are guidelines only and should not be 
considered to provide an exact match.

Get comfortable with screen time. Sequel’s Convergence Boost 
lens technology is easy on the eyes, improving visual comfort 
and clarity without complicating your routine. Designed to 
conquer the visual demands of today’s world, Sequel is the 
everyday lens that delivers unparalleled vision, both on 
screen and off. Best of all, it’s easy to fit, easy to dispense, 
and even easier to wear.
Sequel’s type suite comprises two fonts — 
both with rounded corners to echo the 
approachable quality to that of our 
brandmark. 

Headline font Romek Rounded lends an 
editorial feel to our brand expression 
while retaining high legibility. It’s 
counterpart, Dolph Koo, is a semi-mono 
style font that references the technicality 
and science behind the product while 
balancing a warmth and familiarity.

While the type palette is intentionally 
limited, these 2 fonts do a lot of heavy 
lifting within the visual system, 
complementing each other perfectly.

In the spirit of balancing technicality 
with warmth, our fine linework bridges 
these two worlds, aiding in distinguishing 
hierarchy, visualizing product specs and 
technology, and framing subjects.

When paired with typography, the 
thickness of the stroke weight should be 
roughly equivalent to that of Dolph Koo.

Linework only ever lives in charcoal or 
white. Do not recolor it in any other color.

Our iconography style references the

There are 3 approved color stylings for 
our icons. The outline style should be 
considered primary. Use the other 2 styles 
only when a color accent enhances the 
composition.

When implementing or creating new 
Sequel icons, try to avoid these 
common mistakes.   
In general, our icons are meant to 
substantiate their written 
counterpart, acting as a visual 
signal that further contextualizes 
the product benefit or what it’s 
combatting.
The difference 
is easy to see
Don’t use unapproved styles.
Don’t use unapproved colors.
Don’t use icons as large hero illustrations.
Don’t close path.
Don’t use illustrations with imagery.
Don’t change style or add effects.

Our brand photography consists of three 
categories: Product, Lifestyle, and Studio.
 
Product imagery should be reflective of 
not only the end result, but also nod to 
the science and process that goes into it. 
Lifestyle photography is more literal and 
incorporates both a digital screen-based 
device and the setting in which the 
subject is using that device.

Studio shots are meant to capture the 
emotive feeling of ease and relief. They 
put the subject matter front and center and 
convey a candid and lighthearted spirit.

These categories give us a distinct, yet 
functional library of photos to build on. 
See expanded galleries on the following 
pages.

While it’s difficult to literally show our 
product without the emphasis being placed 
on the frame or the glass, this category 
balances clean, matter-of-fact product 
showcase with more process-driven 
exploded views or detail crop-ins.

Backgrounds should remain clean, flat, and 
unfussy to highlight the technical nuance 
of the subject matter.

This photo category can also be thought 
of as in-context. It shows Sequel users 
actively using their lenses to help them 
with a variety of tasks that rely on 
looking at the screen.

When creating new photos for this 
category, be sure to show not only a wide 
range of ages of the users, but also a 
wide range of use-cases — think working 
on a laptop in a coffee shop, tuned in on 
a desktop in the studio, reading an article 
on a phone, sketching on a tablet, 
watching a TV show, or even gaming with 
controller and headset.

To signal Sequel, ensure there’s a touch 
of yellow (similar to our Yellow 100 +/- 
saturation) somewhere in the frame. This 
can be an accent object in the scene or a 
more present element such as a garment.

Our studio photography captures the 
emotive feeling of comfort, ease, and 
wellness. Just like the subjects of our 
lifestyle photography, it’s important to 
show a wide range of ages. Make sure the 
wearers are captured in a candid and not 
overly staged way.

Lighting should be bright but not over 
exposed. Refrain from dramatic lighting 
and dark shadows.

Backdrops should be a single color (either 
a light-colored neutral or a softer tone of 
our primary Yellow 100). Ensure there’s 
nothing distracting in the background, as 
we want the focus to be on the subject 
and their facial expression.
